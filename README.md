# Inventory Tracking System for Ventilators - RESTful API

Inventory management of critical health care infrastructure including real time usage tracking had become inevitable during the current pandemic. This project aims at building an inventory tracking system for ventilators that allows authorized hospital users to input details of the available inventory and tag it as “occupied”, “available” and “in-maintenance”. The three status can also be updated using a secure RESTful API for real time usage metrics. The application has the ability to also add any ventilator to a specific hospital and search ventilators which are available.

#### APIs Built:

- Read Hospital and Ventilator Details
- Search Ventilators by Status and Hospital Name 
- Search Hospital by Name
- Update Ventilator's Details
- Add Ventilator  
- Delete Ventilator by Ventilator ID

#### Technology Stack:
- NodeJS
